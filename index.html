                        <p>My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer. I love to draw and all that is connected with
                            the design. In this area a long time ago and during this time I managed to create several
                            successful projects used by people all over the world.

                        </p>
                        <p>I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. As I see it,people, it's like my work.

                            soybean skills, creating new interesting creative projects.</p>
